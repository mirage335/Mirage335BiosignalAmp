## generate-gerbers.sh
##
## This script is designed to (for each gEDA-pcb file in the parent
## directory) generate:
##
## 1. A directory named after the pcb filename containing gerbers
##    renamed to work with OSHPark's fabrication service.
##
## 2. A zipfile containing the directory that can up uploaded
##    directly, without modification to OSHPark for fabrication.
##
## Assumptions made by this script:
##
##   1. This script expects to live in a subdirectory of the folder
##      containing your .pcb files.
##
##   2. Internal layers will be stacked in order of group
##      number. For example, in a design with the following groups:
##
##       Group 1 (top-side): Component
##       Group 2 (bottom-side): Solder
##       Group 3: Vcc
##       Group 4: GND
##       Group 5: outline
##
##      What happens is: pcb will output the gerbers with fixed-names
##      for the layers it knows about. So Group 1 (flagged as top),
##      will be output as <name>.top.gbr . Group 2 (flagged as
##      bottom), will similarly be named <name>.bottom.gbr . outline
##      layers are also detected and named appropriately by the pcb
##      export functionality.
##
##      When pcb reaches layers that it doesn't know about, it names
##      them with the absolute group number. So the internal layers on
##      this board will be exported as <name>.group3.gbr and
##      <name>.group4.gbr
##
##      This script assumes that internal layers should be stacked in
##      order of their group number (ascending). So in this example
##      the gerbers will specify a board stacking of: Component, Vcc,
##      GND, Solder . If you wanted the GND layer to appear above the
##      Vcc layer, you'd need to change the GND layer to a smaller
##      group number than Vcc in File->Preferences->Layers under the
##      "Groups" Tab.
##
##   3. This script assumes that if a layer group exists, that it is
##      important. The default pcb template has several unused (empty)
##      layers. If you don't remove them from your pcb file, this
##      script will assume you want a four layer board where the
##      internal layers are empty. This is expensive and (most-likely)
##      stupid. Remove any unused layers in your design.
