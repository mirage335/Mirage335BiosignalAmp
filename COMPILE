For pie chart generation, the following LibreOffice Calc equations are helpful:
=IF(OR($B2="OPA121",$B2="LT1168",$B2="OPA211",$B2="ISO124",$B2="LTC2440",$B2="ATMEGA32U4-AU",$B2="RESISTOR",$B2="CAPACITOR",$B2="POLARIZED_CAPACITOR",$B2="SATA_Connector"),$B2,"OTHER")
=SUMIF($C$2:$C$71,A75,$J$2:$J$71)
